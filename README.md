# Collected material on the Trolley Problem

Originally introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967 and later named and popularized by Judith Jarvis Thomson in 1976, the Trolley Problem is a thought experiment in ethics and moral psychology that explores whether it is morally permissible to sacrifice one person to save several others.
The classic scenario involves a runaway trolley heading toward five people on a track. A bystander or driver can pull a lever to divert the trolley onto another track, where it will kill one person instead.
The ethical dilemma highlights the tension between utilitarian reasoning (maximizing overall well-being) and deontological ethics (adherence to moral rules or duties). It also demonstrates how people's moral judgments can shift depending on small variations in the scenario.
The Trolley Problem and its many variations have become central to discussions in AI ethics, autonomous systems, and moral decision-making.
